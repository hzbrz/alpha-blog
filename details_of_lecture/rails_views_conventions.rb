# For every controller action a view has to exist with file ending: .html.erb

# Anytime this percent blocks are opened it means that we are going to put some Ruby code
# the '=' operator is the only way to display the code in the view without the '=' it is just ruby code
# Link to the URI: pages/home with the prefix pages_home and the path can be got by pages_home_path 

# If it is a model-back form, which it is - because we have an Article model-back
# For dealing with model-back forms Rails provides this helper method called 'form_for'
